        <p>About that album...</p>
        <p>The album comes only weeks after the release of his collaborative studio album Faith Is a Rock with Wiki and The Alchemist. Ahead of its release, little was known about the album with the exception of a few billboards advertising the album in New York and London in late September 2023, making it a surprise release to most. Accompanying the album release, Mike shared an Alex Huggins-directed music video for the song "What U Say U Are" on October 13. Both album and video were promoted at an album release event at Roxy Cinema in New York City. Mike is set to promote the record through a 51-dates tour from February to May 2024 in Europe and North America.</p>

        <h2>MAVI</h2>
        <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0zI5KZ81RN2x6RrQchLLBQ?utm_source=generator" width="95%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
        <P>And more about this album...</P>
        <p>Mavi was expecting to follow his acclaimed 2019 debut, Let the Sun Talk, with a record called Shango, which the 23-year-old rapper has taken to calling “a very manly, muscular album” and which was eventually shelved. In its place came first the slightly tortured EP End of the Earth, released early last year, and now the gently probing Laughing so Hard, it Hurts, a record whose raw nerve endings sizzle and pop to make even its weariest verses seem animated by a desire for contentment, for harmony. It’s intimate by design, with Mavi’s frequently muted voice drawing the listener’s ear close to the speaker, but expansive in scope: Its opening song is named for a folk hero from American slavery, and its closing one traces the running routes through his native Charlotte, North Carolina that are “carved into the small of [his] back.” Languid in spots, but never for too long—its 16 songs last just over 38 minutes—Laughing so Hard suggests a zen state that is being punctured then resealed in endless loop.</p>

        <h2>LUCKI</h2>
        <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6vKVBLTsQW5wXOzmOIkPVZ?utm_source=generator" width="95%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
        <p>basically to sum it up...</p>
        <p>What is most immediately obvious about Lucki’s latest LP, s*x m*ney dr*gs, is the space it offers the rapper to breathe. The FLAWLESS LIKE ME era marked the first major tonal mismatch of the musician’s career, with brash, overblown instrumentals clawing for auditory prominence, smothering his lyricism, and shaving off the qualities that separated him from his peers. It was a sidelining of the MC's unique narratives and cyclical, confessional presence on a track -- and, fortunately, a mistake that smd is quick not to repeat. The album's production suite is airy and optimistic; soothing mists envelop the brilliant "No Bap," open-road guitar lines underscore the synths of "Bby Pluto" and "Purple Heart Ski," and producer Bhristo paints "Pop Star" and "Karma a Bitch" with a refreshing level of dramatic flair. "Str8 Syrup," perhaps the most original-sounding track here, slinks with nocturnal energy, its cryptic instrumental lines weaving around Lucki’s motif-like speech like snakes. Yet, predictably, traces of FLM mark the project’s most inconsistent moments: although the brilliant "Super Ski" continues the scorching energy of "Y NOT?," lowlights "Almighty Tune" and "Gemini Love" inherit FLM’s tiresome, ear-blasting tendencies, with the latter drowning the rapper in a painfully saccharine soundscape. Lyrically, Lucki is on solid form, catching vocal pockets, employing addictive ad-libs, and delivering bars that emotively capture the complexity of a bittersweet fame. Standout tracks "New York," "2021 Vibes," and "Pop Star" markedly keep the circular flows and ad-libbing of his best material -- "I’m scoring lean in a scrimmage/He sip for an image/I never would give him a song," he muses on the former -- while slick motifs like "AMG the S/Codeine cowboy in the flesh" and "Real deal junkie but a businessman/I seal the deal with a seal in hand" set the pace in hypnotic, head-nodding loops. Some of the critiques levied at the rapper’s previous material appear briefly -- there are few verses that "lock" into a single flow and a couple of sub-par choruses (the nasal "You move sloppy" of "Gemini Love" proving particularly featureless) -- yet, despite one or two lackluster records, there’s more high-quality Lucki material in this release than in any of the rapper’s albums post-2019. S*x m*ney dr*gs is a course correction of an LP, steadying the ship into 2023, and it’s good to see Tune finding his footing here.</p>
