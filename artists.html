        <h2>MIKE</h2>

        <p class="quote"> current spotify bio: MIKE is a quintessential old soul. The 24-year-old artist's wisdom is evident in both his calm delivery and measured questioning. Known for introspective, subtly profound rhymes that explore grief, family, and identity, and melt over muffled, soul-seasoned samples, MIKE's newest record, Burning Desire, is his biggest to date: both in length, but more so artistically. For the first time in his career, MIKE truly reaches outside of his immediate circle for collaborators, pulling in everyone from Larry June to Liv.e to Lila Ramani (of Crumb) to Earl Sweatshirt and more. The beloved rapper has come a long way from making waves in underground hip-hop circles with the sLUms] collective formed in New York in 2015. Since, he's released numerous critically celebrated albums, earned Pitchfork's Best New Music accolade twice, and toured with artists like Blood Orange, Earl Sweatshirt, The Alchemist, and Freddie Gibbs. Burning Desire sees MIKE confidently step out as the leader of a new movement within hip hop, as he breaks through the ceiling of the underground and introduces the style of rap he originated to a wider audience. If anything is certain about this next chapter for MIKE, it is that it will be on his own terms.</p>

        <p>Michael Jordan Bonema (born October 13, 1998), known professionally as Mike (often stylized as MIKE), is an American rapper, songwriter and record producer based in New York City. Bonema's non-typical upbringing, having experienced life in New Jersey, England, Philadelphia and New York City, has had an audible influence on his diverse and experimental music style.

            Bonema launched his professional career via his Bandcamp page in 2015. He gained interest from listeners, journalists and industry executives alike as he released several short-run EPs, his first critically reviewed mixtape, Winter New York, and his first full-length project, Longest Day, Shortest Night. Bonema then experienced a break-out year in 2017, as he became recognised within hip hop circles via his next full-length project, entitled May God Bless Your Hustle, in June 2017.
            
            Bonema then released several follow-up projects, including Black Soap in May 2018, quickly followed by Renaissance Man in June 2018 and War in My Pen in December 2018. He has continued to gain external interest from the likes of Pitchfork, The Fader and The New Yorker for his lyricism, music production and cultural influence.
            
            Bonema is a co-founder of Slums (stylised as [sLUms].), an online-focused, underground hip-hop collective consisting of himself, Ad√© Hakim, Jodi.10k (formerly Jazz Jodi), Darryl Johnson, King Carter and Mason Dreiling. He currently releases his music through his own independent record label and publishing company, 10k.</p>


        <p>Whilst living in England in 2008, a young Bonema first gained interest in hip-hop by watching the music videos of Skepta, Chipmunk and N-Dubz with his mother and older sisters. He also states that he was surrounded by Contemporary R&B artists like Chingy and Bow Wow in his early life, as he "lived in a house with lots of girls".

            In 2010, upon Bonema's return to Philadelphia, he began to gain a more comprehensive interest in the culture behind hip-hop. He began to familiarise himself with the emerging American hip-hop scene, stating he studied the works of artists like Chance the Rapper, Drake and Lil Wayne.[1] Bonema recorded his first-ever song, a cover of MF Doom and Madlib's underground hit 'All Caps', in 2012. Bonema reflects on the song as being inspired by his lifestyle in Philadelphia, having an aggressive vocal energy and acting as a simple exercise in discovering how to express himself as a 14-year-old. As Bonema grew older, he began to develop his own tastes in hip-hop and started following artists like Tyler, the Creator, Earl Sweatshirt and other members of the Odd Future collective. By 2013, Bonema started to take hip-hop more seriously, and began releasing music, emailing journalists within the industry and directly communicating with record executives.</p>
